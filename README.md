# Rainbow-DQN

Implementation of the Rainbow DQN Algorithm of DeepMind

Here is the whitepaper ([Rainbow DQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298)) and the notebook with all the implementations ([Rainbow_DQN.ipynb](./Rainbow_DQN.ipynb)).

There is also an implementation of a Replay Buffer with weights ([ReplayBuffer.py](./ReplayBuffer.py))

__NOTE__: I didn't implement some features of this algorithm because it was not needed for the current environment gymnasium (Lunar-Lander-v2) I used.
